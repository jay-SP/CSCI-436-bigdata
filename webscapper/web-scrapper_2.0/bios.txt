I co-founded several highly successful ventures over a 15 year period in industry. Sarooj Construction Company (SCC) was incorporated in the Sultanate of Oman in 2005, as an infrastructure development company. The company has become the leading construction company in Oman, successfully completing more than 170 infrastructure projects amounting to total work in excess of $1 billion in various industry sectors, for both public and private clients. SCC is ISO 9001, 14001 and 45001 accredited.  Synergy Petroleum International was incorporated in the Sultanate of Oman in 2010 as a joint venture with Bauer Resources GmBH, called Bauer-Nimr LLC aimed at introducing innovative solutions to the produced water crisis that Oman, as well as other countries around the world face. A sustainable solution was developed to treat produced water using a combination of bioremediation techniques and traditional mechanical separation. The patented process uses locally sourced materials and gravity driven flow to irrigate local reed plants that complete the lifecycle of produced water, thereby preserving the environment. The project is the largest of its kind in the world spanning an area of 3.5 miles, and has received national and international acclaim and accolades, and is well publicized in the media as a model example for green infrastructure. The most recent is the Award of Excellence in Climate Action at the Qatar Sustainability Summit 2019. It was one of the first public-private partnerships in Oman, and required innovative financing models.  Bauer-Nimr is ISO 9001, 14001 and 45001 accredited.

Research:
High Accuracy Computational Chemistry to Help Solve Experimental ProblemsOur research focuses on developing and utilizing computational methods to provide accurate information for various kinds of molecular and biomolecular systems, particularly those of broad impact on biomedicine and sustainable chemistry.The high accuracy computational results with errors typically within 1-3% experimental ranges build a strong basis to provide critical missing information to help understand important experimental data, correct experimental errors, and guide future experiments with better desired properties/functions. The wide applicability of diversified computational methods from quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence together with the 24/7 availability of computational resources have been facilitating a broad range of scientific investigations to predict geometric, electronic, spectroscopic, mechanistic, material properties of systems from small molecules to large biomolecules, in gas, liquid, or solid phases. Such high quality computational research coupled with a comprehensive training protocol of scientific vision, scientific thinking, research skills, management skills, leadership skills, communication skills etc offer excellent opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to learn, practice, and achieve strong real-world problem solving skills.Our prior research has enabled 1) accurate predictions of ~20 widely used spectroscopic properties with theory-versus-experiment correlation coefficient R2 around 0.99; 2) accurate structure refinement and determination for active sites of ~20 metalloproteins; 3) unprecedented mechanistic details for >20 important therapeutic agents, proteins of clinical interest, and green catalysts/biocatalysts.Among a total of 135 published/accepted papers, 51 are in the following high-profile journals with impact factor (IF) >~9: 26 in J. Am. Chem. Soc. (most cited chemical journal with IF of 15.0), 11 in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. (2nd most cited chemical journal with IF of 16.6), 3 in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (4th most cited journal in multidisciplinary sciences with IF of 11.1), 1 in Nat. Chem. (IF of 21.8), 1 in Nat. Comm. (IF of 16.6), 1 in Small (IF of 13.3), 3 in ACS Catal. (IF of 12.9), 1 in Acta Phys.-Chim. Sin. (IF of 10.9), 3 in Chin. Chem. Lett. (IF of 9.1), and 1 in Chem. Sci. (IF of 8.4). The average journal IF of all his papers published at US tenured/tenure-track positions is 9.0. The complete list of the publications can be seen via this URL: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hDumUHUAAAAJ&hl=enOur current research interests are mainly in the following areas:1) metalloprotein/metal mediated binding, formation, conversion, and detection of biological HNO and NO. These small molecules play vital roles in the cellular survival and signaling/regulation activities. Studies of NO’s effects in biomedicine have been awarded Nobel Prize. HNO, as a sibling molecule of NO, also plays unique roles in many biological processes, such as vascular relaxation, enzyme activity regulation, and neurological function regulation. It was found to be more favorable than NO to treat medical problems such as heart failure, and has potential applications in treating alcoholism, cancer, and other diseases. But many structural and mechanistic details of these important functional processes are still unknown. Our group has been continuously providing some previously unknown critical structural and mechanistic information in this area, such as the first atomic level HNO bound protein active site structure, first heme and non-heme protein mediated HNO to NO conversion mechanistic pathway details, and first metal-based selective HNO sensor's reactivity mechanism, and first non-native one-electron reduction reactivity mechanism for NO in models of nitric oxide reductases. We are now expanding our research to more of such systems and reactions to provide novel mechanistic ideas for sensor optimization, drug activity improvement, and signal transduction rewiring to help advance relevant biomedical research.2) Bioengineered catalysts with artificial functions for sustainable chemistry. To make our earth sustainable is very important to everyone and our future generations. In order to help reach this grand goal, one fundamental topic in sustainable chemistry is to develop excellent catalysts that can utilize inexpensive earth-abundant and environmentally benign elements (no toxicity) to perform highly reactive and selective atom-economic chemical transformations for manufacturing various desired materials, drugs, and other useful substances, at room temperature and ambient pressure (no additional cost for high or low temperature/pressure management), in aqueous solution (no toxic organic solvents). Nature has many beautiful examples and engineering native enzymes with new artificial functions for numerous important non-native chemical transformations has shown highly promising reactivity and selectivity results for sustainable chemistry. Novel heme protein based biocatalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for a wide range of chemical reactions, including but not limited to cyclopropanation, C-H functionalization, Si-H insertion, N-H insertion, S-H insertion, B-H insertion, aldehyde olefination, sigmatropic rearrangement, cyclopropenation, bicyclobutanation. A recent Nobel Prize was awarded to a few experimental pioneers in this field. Our group has provided some first computational mechanistic insights into the electronic structures of heme carbenes and the origins of their reactivity, stereoselectivity, and chemoselectivity results in various heme carbene transfer reactions (such as cyclopropanation, C-H insertion, and Si-H insertion), which have facilitated many experimental studies. We are now expanding our research to more bioengineered catalysts and more non-native reactions to further advance this field toward a more sustainable life for our world.3) Accurate drug binding structures and pro-drug activation mechanisms. Accurate structures of how drugs bind to their biomolecular targets pave an essential ground for structure-based drug discovery. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining x-ray structures of many drug-biomolecule complexes and the accuracy problem of conventional x-ray crystallography (to name a few examples: positional uncertainty of up to e.g. ~0.7 Å in bond length and ~90°in bond angle, structural uncertainty of messed identities of C/N/O atoms, and uncertainty of protonation states), there is a strong need to determine accurate drug binding structures. In addition, many drugs are pro-drugs, which need to be transformed to their active forms for pharmaceutical functions. Our group has provided accurate atomic level structures of some important bisphosphonate-protein complexes and their associate interaction modes, which help find new drug leads and understand the mechanistic origin of their drug activity and selectivity. Such drugs have a billion-dollar global pharmaceutical market and exhibit excellent activities in treating bone-resorption diseases, Paget’s disease, and cancer. Our group has previously also revealed the activation mechanism of the bestseller anticancer drug cisplatin. We are now exploring some new types of drugs to selectively inhibit some proteins of clinical interest and elucidating mechanisms of certain pro-drugs to treat cancers and blood diseases to help more people in the world.Current Group MembersGraduate student:Jia-Min ChuSomayeh TavasolikejaniUndergraduate student:Dariya BaizhigitovaDaisy MorganVrinda ModiCatherine MinteerA total of 19 graduate and 38 undergraduate students have been trained for research in this group, including 65% from underrepresented groups (women and minorities).After receiving the training in this lab at Stevens, all PhD students won some awards and many undergraduate students won up to 7 awards and scholarships, including national level honors such as ACS Division of Physical Chemistry Undergraduate Award, ACS Division of Inorganic Chemistry Undergraduate Award, and one of only 25 Physical Chemistry students nationwide selected to present at ACS national meetings.Many students have publications in prestigious or even top journals, including undergraduate students.For those who went to graduate and medical schools, each receives up to 7 offers from prominent universities such as Yale, John Hopkins, Cornell/Rochefeller/MSK, UCLA, University of Michigan, New York University, Rutgers.In addition, a number of students become scientists and professors in academia or industry after graduation from this lab.High quality undergraduate and graduate students with strong motivations are welcome to contact Professor Yong Zhang regarding the potential opportunity of joining his group's interesting and rewarding scientific endeavors.Equipment:This lab has a computational cluster in the university's Data Center with 436 cores, 1014 GB RAM, and 7.2 TB hard drive, with additional access to a school computational cluster of 880 cores, 4160 GB RAM, and 240 TB hard drive.

My primary research interests are accretion disks, accreting white dwarfs, core collapse supernovae, astrophysical fluid dynamics, boundary layers, convection, dynamos, radiative transfer and numerical simulations. I focus a lot of my efforts on understanding accretion onto white dwarfs because these are the best systems to confront accretion theory with observations. I then hope to apply the knowledge gained here to other astrophysical systems.

Research:
Research that has spanned the last decade is mentoring teams of students (8 to 12 students, depending on the year) for the construction of a sounding rocket payload. The teams can devise an experiment of their own choosing, construct it, and then test their experiment during a launch that reaches elevations up to 75 miles above the earth. As the world anticipates human travel to Mars and commercial space flight, Stevens students participate in their own space endeavor as part of NASA’s Rock SAT-C program, a program that invites students from universities across the country to build their own experimental payloads. The NASA sponsored Rock SAT-C program is annually funded at about $33,000 per year to defray the costs of payload design, delivery, travel and lodging for the participants. The Stevens team, comprised of both undergraduate and graduate students, works on a year-long project culminating in a rocket launch in June at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. While launching a payload with experiments on a Terrier-improved Orion sounding rocket is an exciting accomplishment, the real value is in the process leading up to the launch. The team goes through the same design review process that NASA engineers go through — six design reviews. The students learn that space is a harsh environment. They find out that one can have yearlong plans go wrong and then must figure out what to do the next cycle. Some students say that the sounding rocket project is harder than their senior design project.The RockSat-C program is a national program with details at:https://www.nasa.gov/sounding-rockets/rocksat-programsThe Rock-SAT-C program utilizes about a person month of faculty time throughout the year. Dean Thangam writes a letter of matching funds for Rutgers and for NASA. There is the 10-day launch period in June (~14th to 23rd), when the team travels to Wallops Island, Virginia. Also, there are weekly zoom meetings on Sunday afternoons at 1:30 PM and zoom meetings with NASA about once a month on Wednesday nights.

Name: Rainer Martini
Education:
PhD (1999) RWTH Aachen (Physics) BS (1995) University Bonn (Physics)
Research:
The recent and ongoing developments in material growth, processing and structuring down to the nanometer scale gives access to a new dimension of control in the matter-light interaction. This allows for new as well as much more efficient use of well-known phenomena, relying in most cases on the quantum-mechanical nature of the interaction. Dr. Martini's research explores these newly accessible phenomena in favor of more effective imaging, sensing and / or communication devices – targeting some of the major problems that today's world is facing. In particular the following areas represent the main focus of the ongoing research in his laboratory:Direct all-optical modulation of laser and detectors: The optical electrical conversion of information at each communication is one of the major bottlenecks in communication technology. In his our laboratory different approaches are used to achieve direct optical modulation of lasers and detectors to achieve an all-optical and hence ultrafast wavelength converter – and in turn multiplexer and de-multiplexer devices. Within the last years he and his co-workers have proven the direct optical amplitude modulation of mid-infrared Quantum Cascade Lasers up to a frequency of 7 GHz – limited only by detector speed.New form of optical modulation: Aside from the expected amplitude modulation, his lab has achieved a fast (2GHz) frequency modulation. This gives rise to a direct optical FM modulation of lasers and hence allowing more robust and stable data transmission. Possible additional features are the simultaneous modulation via optical and electrical means, which would allow for higher level modulation such as phase modulation, QPSK, and QAM.Novel techniques in Free-Space Optical communication: The application of yet unused spectral wavelength like the Mid- and Far- Infrared spectrum is one of the core research areas in his laboratory – where his laboratory has achieved international reputation of being the authority in IR-FSOC.New form of Infrared Imaging Devices and their application: Mid- and Far-Infrared Imaging devices have become popular in multiple areas reaching from security aspects to medical diagnostics and material inspections. Within Dr. Martini's laboratory new wavelength conversion techniques are applied to allow for simpler but more powerful imaging concepts towards an easier access to this specific section of the spectrum.New broadband imaging devices: Based on some results of the above mentioned infrared conversion approach, Dr. Martini and his co-workers were able to build a camera system allowing for monitoring and analysis of beam patterns. Unique to this device is its ability to observe and measure beam profiles ranging from 400nm (UV) down to 110 GHz, covering the whole range from UV, Vis, NIR, MIR, FIR, to RF.

Research:
Michael's research focuses on directly applying formalism to practical problems. Much of his work takes place in the emerging field of semantics engineering, where he scales PL techniques up to work on real systems.His primary focus is on improving the POSIX shell and building tools to support it and its ecosystem, but he works in a variety of other areas, too: contracts and gradual types; tools for directly expressing PL formalism, using logic programming and SMT solving; and foundational semantics for decidable languages, like Kleene algebra with tests.
Experience:
Michael received BAs in Computer Science and Egyptology from Brown University (2007) and his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania (2013); previously, he was an assistant professor at Pomona College. His work ranges from functional-reactive JavaScript (with Shriram Krishnamurthi at Brown) to runtime verification of higher-order programs (with Benjamin Pierce at Penn) to software-defined networking (with Dave Walker at Princeton) to present activities focused on the POSIX shell and executable formalism.

Research:
Fluid dynamics, the study of fluids in motion, lies at the heart of most questions people ask about the ocean. Increasing numbers of people are moving to its coastlines, yet the added stress we put on the ocean can overwhelm its benefits. Evaluating problems such as storm surges, climate change, and pollution requires a detailed knowledge of ocean, estuary, and atmosphere transport processes.I enjoy living and working in a metro region with 22 million people mostly living on islands like Manhattan and increasingly connected to their surrounding waterways. I’m a Research Associate Professor of ocean engineering, and my specific research interests include estuary and coastal ocean physics, storm surges and sea level rise, urban flood adaptation, air-sea interaction, urban and coastal atmospheric science, and computational ocean and atmosphere modeling.

I. Design and Synthesis of Novel Analogs of antiviral drug, molnupiravir.                                                                      Molnupiravir is an anti-influenza experimental drug that has been granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral replication through RNA mutagenesis by targeting the enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The focus of the present work is to investigate into different strategies for the synthesis of novel analogs of molnupiravir. These novel analogs will have structural changes made to the uracil moiety as well as the side chain. The analogs will be evaluated for their antiviral activities.I. Development of Novel Antibiotics Effective against Resistant BacteriaThis project focuses on developing novel antibiotics active particularly against resistant organisms. These novel compounds are designed based on the structure of a highly potent cyclic peptide antibiotic, Lugdunin, isolated from Staphylococcus lugdunensis strains in human nasal commensals. Lugdunin was found to be highly potent against Gram-positive organisms, particularly difficult to treat methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci strains. The focus of the present study is to establish a practical synthesis of Lugdunin which will be a guide to synthesize various analogs. Novel analogs of cyclic peptide antibiotics were synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis.Areas of specialty: Medicinal Chemistry, Organic Synthesis, Structure-based drug design

Research:
My research addresses the knowledge-gap in our ability to connect the in situ chemical composition and structure of heterogeneous catalysts to the selective activation of chemical bonds. This addresses two of the grand challenges for heterogeneous catalysis in energy and sustainability this century: (1) production of fuels and value-added chemicals from biomass and plastic waste and (2) accelerated capture and conversion of carbon dioxide. In both of these challenges, there is a critical need for fundamental, nanoscale insight into the surface reactions, accounting for the coverage and configuration dependent interactions between adsorbates and surface components that lead to overlayer formation and catalyst reconstruction under working conditions. Without an accurate, nanoscale picture of the dynamic interplay between adsorbates, catalyst surface structure and composition, and performance, the kinetic and mechanistic properties of multi-component catalysts cannot be effectively and precisely connected to the composition and structure of active sites formed during reaction. This in turn severely limits opportunities for the rational design of complex catalyst materials.My research group directly tackles this critical need by combining multi-scale computational simulations (i.e. density functional theory, Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, etc.) with data science techniques (i.e. cluster expansions, regression modeling, machine learning, etc.) to (1) sample the catalytically relevant configuration space for multi-component surfaces under working conditions,(2) identify the rate limiting transition states across a range of multi-component catalysts, and (3) design multi-component surfaces for targeted bond activation. This approach establishes the physically accessible catalytically active sites and enables quantitative connections between nanoscale interactions and experimentally measurable surface structure, composition, and catalytic performance. Our ultimate goal is to discover nanoscale parameters that obviate the need for further experiments because, simply put, we already know the answer.

Experiments are being conducted to determine the plasma characteristics necessary for the destruction of organic substances deposited on aluminum surface, to identify the proper plasma gases for effective removal, to determine the role of the surface on destruction efficiency, and to evaluate surface changes due to plasma irradiationUse of Capillary Non-Thermal, Ambient Pressure Plasma in Decontamination of Water Recovered from Vehicle Exhaust: Investigate the potential role of diffused non-thermal plasma in the treatment of water condensate recovered from the exhaust of the diesel engines of Hum-Vee and other vehicles. One treatment scenario involves pre-treatment of the combustion mixture in order to increase the efficiency of combustion and thus reduce the concentration of undesirable organic products in the diesel exhaust gases. The second treatment scheme focuses on plasma treatment of the exhaust gases prior to condensation. Finally, a treatment system is investigated which treats the aqueous solution obtained from the condenser by continuously passing the vapors produced from the liquid phase through a plasma reactor in a closed loop configuration

Research:
Our food supply is affected by insufficient produce, even under the most favorable environmental conditions. This problem is compounded by arid and high salinity regions. To find a solution, my research analyzes the genome and protein- protein interactions of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) under unfavorable growth conditions to understand the interactions in plants that regulate or are regulated by environmental stress conditions. Ifwe know which molecular factors are affected by stressful conditions in plants, we can increase yield to alleviate growing hunger around the world to a population that isincreasingly demanding more food; even when conditions may not naturally be favorable to produce a variety of crop in environments we may think of as barren waste lands due to drought or nutrient deficiency. One of the mechanisms that are known to be associated with affecting plant development in environmental stress conditions is the Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) protein. RACK1 is a scaffold protein with three genes (RACK1A, RACK1B and RACK1C) that is ubiquitously expressed in Eukaryotic organisms. This protein contains 40 repeats of tryptophan-aspartic acid and bridge the interaction of its binding partners, integrating cellular signals to control transcription, translation and as a result regulates plant growth and development. Its association with signaling affects growth in drought and salt stress, growth hormones, innate immunity, and sugar distribution in plants. RACK1 has been shown to affect the global accumulation of miRNA and as a result plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin. miRNAs are single stranded non-coding RNAs that serveas gene regulators in a wide range of organisms. ABA and auxin are plant phyto-hormones. RACK1 negatively regulates the stress hormone ABA pathway and is known to positively regulate auxin. An array of miRNAs regulates the ABA stress mediateddrought signaling pathways. I have shown that RACK1 induction of miR393 (miR393A and miR393B) signaling down regulates auxin and as a result A. thaliana acclimation to salt stress. My research with students will therefore further elucidate the implication of the proposed interactions of RACK1 with miRNAs and their effects on ABA and auxin in plant growth and development. We will analyze the role of RACK1-miR393 pathway in regulation of plant hormones ABA and auxin. This interaction will be elucidated using single and double mutants of RACK1 and miR393 in various environmental stress conditions such as drought and salt. Our mutations will make use of mendelian crosses and CRISPR/Cas9 techniques.  We will apply genome and protein analysis to make conclusions to support what we see phenotypically (germination, root growth, guard cells and chlorophyll accumulation in leaves). Understanding the precise molecular mechanism of drought stress signaling and nutrient deficiency mediated by the interaction of RACK1, miRNA and plant phytohormones ABA and auxin will allow developing engineered crops better suited to withstandstressful conditions.

Computational ResearchThe Grail project is ongoing research to rebuild the web for secure transactions. It includes a prototype client written in C++ and OpenGL, and a protocol using binary data and local storage to achieve very high performance. We have now demonstrated rendering gains from 10 to 50 times faster than a typical browser, memory requirements that are less than 1 percent of browsers, and rendering maps using optimized local files that is 500 times faster than our target benchmark, the Johns Hopkins COVID display.Educational ResearchI have been working on improved techniques of instruction for engineering and particularly programming instruction. I have trained and observed dozens of teachers in K-12, training them in the specific skills they need to be more effective. I have taught a short introduction to teachers for "The 10 Hours after Hour of Code" to hundreds of teachers. The classroom materials I designed are core to two programs in use in more than 50 schools.Liquiz is an assessment tool that vastly reduces the amount of work to take programming and other technical material and embed questions. This project is suspended while I focus on Grail but the main obstacle is connecting via LTI to Canvas, that is production issues and devops. The software itself would be phenomenally useful.

Soil and Water Chemistry, Environmental Quality and Remediation, Risk Assessment, Green Technology DevelopmentResearch in my group reflects my firm belief in a holistic, multidisciplinary framework for developing a sustainable environment. My approach is from the angle of earth system science that requires the applications of geochemical, biological, and engineering principles in solving issues related to the environmental quality and its ultimate effect on ecosystem and human health. My students, postdocs, and I are engaged in research that can be broadly classified in the following categories:(1) Application of Soil and Water Chemistry Principles in Environmental Contamination Characterization: Characterization and quantification of various physico-chemical processes that determine the behavior of inorganic and organic contaminants in soil, water, and sediments; the relevant processes and the interrelationships among them over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Long-term goals are to develop fundamental understanding of processes based on experimental and theoretical investigations, as well as to modify predictive capabilities of the expected system behavior, management, and control technologies. Includes geochemical modeling and spectroscopic evaluation of processes at liquid-solid-biota interface.(2) Application of Environmental Chemistry, Environmental Engineering, and Sustainability Principles in Green Technology Development: Evaluation of field, greenhouse, and experimental data (macroscopic and microscopic) to investigate human bioavailability, aqueous and solid phase speciation, dissolution, mineralization, precipitation and adsorption mechanisms of organic and inorganic chemicals in soil, water, and sediments. Development of “green” remediation technologies guided by sustainability principles. Emphasis on investigating environmental behavior, fate, and remediation of emerging contaminants that have not been studied extensively.(3) Application of Soil and Water Chemistry, Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Principles in Sustainable Environmental Remediation: In collaboration with plant scientists, evaluation of bioremediation and phytoremediation alternatives to cleanup environmental contaminants in soil and water. Employ biochemical and molecular biological techniques to study the mechanisms of organics and metals biodegradation and detoxification in plant systems.(4) Risk Assessment: Estimation of ecological and human health risk for environmental decision-making, especially those involving protective and clean-up standards for contaminants in the environment.Ongoing research projects include:Sustainable management of polluted road runoff using green best management practices (GBMP).Green technology development for nutrient and metals reduction in coastal waters.Sustainable remediation of PFAS-contaminated soil and water.Removal of emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals, explosive constituents) from domestic and industrial wastewater using accumulator plants in constructed wetlands settings.Energy generation (ethanol, biogas) from spent biomass utilized for phytoremediation of organic contaminants.Development of new varieties of biochar and their application in environmental remediation.Phytoremediation of soil-lead in residential properties and brownfield sites.Sustainable reclamation of acid mine drainage impacted coal mining sites.Application of advanced oxidation processes for removal of metals, organics, and emerging contaminants in groundwater.A detailed list of ongoing and completed research projects can be obtained from my Resume/CV.

Research:
The current focus of my lab is to develop and use microfluidic-based 3D human tissue models (i.e., “human tissue on chip”) to study inflammatory and infectious diseases and explore novel therapy. Especially, my overarching research goals for the past ten years have been to: (1) reproduce ex vivo the pathophysiological interactions among cancer, stroma, and immune cells in bone marrow by developing "human bone marrow on chip:" (2) bring new insights into poorly understood mechanisms of drug-resistant survival of multiple myeloma and prostate cancer cells that metastasize to bone marrow; and (3) study how tumor cells evade immunity so that immunotherapy can be developed to be more efficacious for these incurable cancers. Recently, inspired by the unprecedented challenge caused by Covid-19 to humanity, we have begun to study the role of “cytokine storm” in the progression of alveolar blood barrier dysfunction and pulmonary edema by developing “human lung on chip.” Our focus for this new endeavor is to develop and evaluate therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating overly reactive immune response in respiratory infectious diseases.

Research:
My research is dedicated to tackling the challenges of drug design and development by using machine learning, molecular simulations and high-throughput screening. In particular, our lab focuses on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and antibodies.The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a crucial public health problem due to the dissemination of bacterial strains that are resistant to multiple antibiotic drugs. AMPs are promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics. One of the most desirable advantages of AMPs is that bacterial resistance would evolve much more slowly than against antibiotics. However, AMPs can exhibit undesirable properties as drugs, including short circulating half-life, instability and toxicity to animals and humans. Therefore, novel approaches are needed to be developed to make AMPs less toxic for human while maintaining or improving their potency to eliminate bacteria and reduce the production cost.Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been used as therapeutic drugs for over 30 years. One of the outstanding issues of antibody drug is the poor stability of some drug candidates such as high aggregation, elevated viscosity and low solubility. This hinders the development of new antibodies. The production cost of antibodies is high, therefore developing computational tools that can predict antibody stability in the early-stage discovery is desired.

Research:
Cancers often relapse: why? My lab is interested in understanding how tumor-initiating cells persist in intestinal cancers. The research focus is on the molecular mechanisms underlying cell-fate plasticity, which allows colon tumor cells to switch their fate to colon cancer stem cells that are responsible for the colon tumor growth. To investigate the mechanism that allows cell fate plasticity, and thus the persistence of colon cancer stem cells, we are using a mutant mouse model that display cell fate-plasticity and tumor initiation. Our research is expected to inform novel therapeutic strategies targeting tumor relapse.We use a combination of vivo mouse models and ex vivo intestinal organoid cultures to answer our research questions using various molecular biology techniques.

Research:
Chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms on catalytic surfacesResearch in the Catalytic Nanoparticles Lab focuses on reaction mechanism studies on surfaces of solid catalysts for petroleum refining, chemical, pharmaceutical and related industries. The scale gap between observable reaction rates and catalytic surface reactions on the molecular level is bridged through iterative cycles of experimental catalyst characterization and testing in combination with DFT calculations. Experimental information establishes the basis for the selection of models and the level of theory for DFT calculations and then, in turn, results of the DFT calculations help to deconvolute and better interpret experimental data. In contrast with traditional catalyst models that assume a static surface, our approach of combining kinetic studies, IR and Raman spectroscopic measurements and DFT calculations with vibrational analyses allows us to develop new methodologies for describing dynamic catalytic surface changes under reaction conditions and, consequently, for a transformational improvement in the description, control and further development of catalytic processes.

My research is to develop natural language processing algorithms to process, organize, and preserve large data set in minority languages. Modern machine learning or natural language processing algorithms tend to be limited to rich-resource languages such as English and Spanish, which greatly limits its potential to be applied for minority languages. My effort is to create a theoretical and more generalized natural language framework so that it can be applied to such languages.NOTE: I  do not have openings for research assistants and teaching assistants.

Name: Abhishek Sharma
Education: No education information available
Research:
The overarching goal of Sharma lab is to design and develop novel-molecular reactivity and molecular function to ultimately accelerate the discovery of new therapeutics.The emergence of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a prominent challenge in the treatment of cancer as well as bacterial infections. In order to overcome this challenge, it is vital to not only develop drugs with novel mechanisms of action but also to expedite the chemical synthesis of these next generation anticancer and antibacterial agents. Some of our ongoing research projects are highlighted below.We design, synthesize and evaluate mechanistically novel antiestrogens that can potently block the proliferative action of estrogen receptors in endocrine-therapy resistant breast cancer.We are also interested in the design and development of small organic molecules that can inhibit protein-protein interactions or probe the physiological/pathological functions of biological receptors and enzymes.Our another major focus area is the development of novel organoboron building blocks and synthetic methods that significantly expand the chemical space of bioactive molecules and protein conjugates. In a complementary approach, we seek to design new types of organoboron-based molecular probes to illuminate and modulate the biological function of disease-relevant proteins.For more information: visit www.sharmalab.orgPublications(* = corresponding author)After joining Stevens37) SERDs: A case study in targeted protein degradation; L.

Research:
Dr. Qu’s research interest crosses several areas including micromechanics of composites, interfacial fracture and adhesion, fatigue and creep damage in metallic and polymer materials, fuel cells and batteries, thermomechanical reliability of microelectronic packaging, and ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation of advanced engineering materials.  His discovery of a reciprocity relation between the reflection and transmission coefficients at anisotropic bimaterial interfaces has led to the development of several ultrasonic techniques for nondestructive evaluation of composite laminates. He is a recognized expert in interfacial fracture mechanics.  His solution to the Eshelby inclusion problem with imperfect interfaces provided a building block for developing micromechanics solutions of the effective properties of composites with imperfect interfaces.

Research:
My primary research interest is in the application of microwave irradiation for organic synthesis. Using a “Green Chemistry” approach, several reactions are studied in a “solventless” environment and using microwave irradiation. Reactions can also be carried out in a shorter time without the use of complex reaction apparatus and set-up. It also includes the evaluation of how the reaction equilibrium is affected when it is conducted using microwave irradiation as opposed to traditional methods of synthesis. I have also extended the use of microwave irradiation to studies in (microwave-assisted) polymer degradation and remodeling polymer characteristics for recycling and / or re-purposing for other applications.Areas of Specialty: Synthesis for Drug Development
