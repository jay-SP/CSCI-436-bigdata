Courses:
From 2004 to 2021, my duties were to teach the Engineering Design I, II, III & IV courses in Robotics (C++), Data Acquisition (C++ and LabVIEW), Truss & Beam Construction, and Electronics (MATLAB/Simulink); Approx. 150 to 190 students/semester from 2004 to 2021. The Engineering Design Spine uses an inter-disciplinary approach, introducing the concepts of Systems Engineering to the Stevens undergraduate student body. Design I, II, III and IV focus on EE, ME, Computer Software & Engineering and Project Management.During 2021, I transitioned into teaching the Design 4 lecture course entitled “Design of Dynamical Systems” and “Introduction to Programming and Algorithmic Thinking” both courses combined consist of 250 to 425 students.
